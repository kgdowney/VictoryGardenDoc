          <article>
            <p>You may not be able to carry a gun or drive a tank, but you can grow food for Victory! The scarcity of food is no longer something that may happen --it is here RIGHT NOW!</p> 
            <p>Canned, dried and frozen vegetables have been rationed. Some experts estimate that we will receive about 70% of the amount that we had last year. WHY NOT RAISE YOUR OWN? Have as many of them as you want! Have the finest tasting vegetables a king could have, gathered fresh from your own garden.</p>
            
            <h4>Gardens a Patriotic Duty</h4>
            <p>
              Our Government urges you to raise food because in so doing you will save metal that would have been used for cans. You will save the fuel that would have been used to carry the food to your local store. You will save the space on railroad trains that is so vitally needed for the transportation of ammunition and supplies for our armed forces. You will ahve the satisfaction of knowing that you are doing your part in helping to win the war.
            </p>

         <h4>You Will Save a Lot of Money</h4>
            <p>For $2 or $3 you will be able to buy enough seeds and plants for the average family. These will supply you all summer longer and well into the fall with practically all of the vegetables you will need, plus some for canning.</p>
            <p>You know how hugh the prices of vegetables have gone right now, They will probably go higher next summer. Your own garden is the answer! No toher investment will bring you such big returns.</p>

            <h4>Gardening Improves Your Health</h4>
            <p>"What you need is exercise" has been the recommendation of many a doctor when people have asked what is the matter with them. Gardening will supply the finest exercise any doctor could ask for. It is all done outdoors in the pure fresh air and sunshine. It will help you get in better physical shape than you have been in for years. It will awaken an appetite and make you sleep more soundly.</p>

            <h4>A New Hobby for Millions</h4>
            <p>A fascinating game! That's what gardening is. From the time the green seedlings break through the crust of the earth, to the great day when you sit down to your first meal of tender vegetables grown by your own efforts, you will have one thrill after another as Mother Nature unfolds her miracles. Whether it's the dew on the leaves early in the morning or the fragrance that hovers over every garden after a summer shower, you will discover many new pleasure, and wonder why you didn't have a garden long ago.</p>

          <header>How To Locate Your Garden</header>
          <article>
            <p>The ideal location, is of course, right in your own back yard, if that is possible. Next best is that empty lot next door, if you are fortunate enough to have on there. Ask the owner for permission to use it. It's wartime- he will be glad to tell you to go ahead. Don't go too far away from your home. Remeber that you will have to carry your tools and other material each time you want to work. The fact that your garden will require watering is another reason to locate it as near your home as possible. A handy water faucet to which you can attach a hose i much preferred to running back and forth with a watering-can. If the summer is dry the availability of a hose will be absolutely necessary.</p>

          <header>Requirements for a Good Garden</header>
          <article>
            <h4>Plenty of Good Sunshine</h4>
            <p>It's the sun that makes vegetables grow, so be sure that your garden is well away from trees. They will not only keep the sun away, but their roots will steal moisture and noursihment from the ground. A simple rule to follow is keep your garden as many feet away from a tree as the tree is high. For example, if the nearest tree is twenty feet high, keep the edge of your garden at least twent feet away from its trunk. The same rule also applied to any nearby shrubs or bushes</p>
            
            <h4>Good, Deep Top Soil</h4>
            
            <p>Good top soil is just as important as sunshine. You cannot grow crops where the top soil has been removed or where it is only a few inches deep. A depth of at least 8 inches is desirable. It should be quite free of rocks and stones or you will find it very difficult to work. It should be comparatively level or the soil is apt to wash away. A lawn that has been turned over makes one of the best soils you could have. Whatever the nature of your top soil may be, it can be greatly improved by your own efforts as explained on <a href="#Preparation_of_the_soil">Preparation of the Soil</a></p> 
            
            <h4>Drainage Necessary</h4>
            
            <p>Most level or slightly sloping plots of ground will have good drainage. Low lying ground that remains wet for any considerable length of time after a rain storm is not satisfactory. Ground that is always swampy and wet, is of course, no place for a vegetable garden.</p>

          <header>How Big Should a Garden Be?</header>
          <article>
            <p>
              There are factors to be considered before you decide how big your garden should be.
            </p>
            <h4>First</h4><p>How big is the best available space? You may not want to use all of it but you may also have to be satisfied with a smaller space than you would like to have. You can have your garden in two sections if that is the only way you can get sufficient space for your plans. The closer these sections are together the easier they will be to attend.</p>
            <p>
              
            <h4>Second</h4><p>How experienced are you at gardening? While there is nothing mysterious or difficult about raising vegetables, a beginner will not be able to work as fast as an experienced gardener, or be as good a judge of how much work is cutting out for himself. He may find later that he is unwilling or unable to do the necessary amount of work to bring the crops through to their ripening stage. Remember, too, that a modest garden will supply you with a surprising aquantity of vegetables. Of course, if too much ripens at once for your own use (and you don't can it) you can always share it with your neighbors (but it does mean extra work for you). Review the plans of various size gardens as shown on ___ and select one that you can successfully handle. If you are experienced you need little guidance. Undoubtedly you will plan one big enough to meet your current needs, as well as supply you with a surplus for canning or storage. We also advise the beginner to stick to the easy-to-grow annuals and leave the perennials, such as asparagus, strawberries and rhubarb to the experienced gardener. Of the annuals it is well to leave out your plans such vegetables as cauliflower, watermelons and celery because they are somewhat more difficult to grow.</p>
            
            <h4>Third</h4><p>Plan to grow the things that you and your family like best. Radishes are fine for people who like them, but why grow them if you don't?</p>
            
            <h4>Fourth</h4><p>Plan to grow a succession of crops. This is the most important reason for having a definite plan on paper before you start. It is the only way to insure a steady supply of fresh vegetables all season. Where your space is limited such a plan will also help you get two or three quick growing crops from a single row.</p>
            
            <h4>Fifth</h4><p>Consider the point value of rationed canned vegetables. Certain crops are going to have a high point value and will take more of your coupons to buy. At the time of this writing it is forecast that Carrots, Beets, Corn and Spinach will have high point values and should therefore be included in your plan. Study these factors carefully before you decide on your plan.</p>

            <p>The dates are those of the average last Spring frosts. Check your location, turn to page 23, and note planting dates which are based on April 15th as last frost. Adjust to your locality by adding or subtracting difference in weeks between that date and date shown above for your section of country.</p>

          <header>You Will Need These Tools</header>
          <article>
            <h4>SELECTION IMPORTANT</h4>
            <p>You don't need many tools, but the ones you get should be of good quality. They will make your work much easier and will last much longer. Buy tools that suit your strength. Obviously, a woman not used to gardening will not want tools as heavy or big as those suited to a strong man.</p>
            
            <h4>A Wheelbarrow</h4>
            <p>Be sure to have one. No other tool will save you so much labor and time in garden work. Almost any type will do.</p>
            
            <h4>A Spading Fork</h4>
            <p>For general digging. It has four flat prongs. It is lighter and better than a spade for turning over and breaking up lumps of soil. You will also use it for manure and compost and for diggin up potatoes and other crops in the fall.</p>
            
            <h4>A Good Spade</h4>
            <p>Also for general digging and shoveling. Be sure you get one with a blade ten or twelve inches long. One about six or seven inches wide is right for men--four or five inches for women.</p>
            
            <h4>An Iron Rake</h4>
            <p>For leveling off ground that has been loosened; for stones and trash. Get one that has ten to fourteen iron teeth, that curves in. Most people prefer the bow type.</p>
      
            <h4>A Hoe is Essential</h4>
            <p>For weeding, cultivating and planting. You will also use it for hilling up corn and other vegetables. The common garden type hoe is best.</p>
            
            <h4>A Cultivator for Speed</h4>
            <p>Better than a hoe for cultivating. Does more work with less effort. Once the plants start to grow you will use it more than any other tool. Get the speedy prong type. For larger gardens get one with adjustable tynes. Very large gardens should have a wheel cultivator.</p>
            
            <h4>Strong Cord Guide Line</h4>
            <p>Essential in laying out straight rows. Put a knot in the line every three feet to help you make measurements quickly. Tie stakes at each end.</p>
      
            <h4>Hose and Sprinkler</h4>
            <p>No garden is complete without one long enough to reach all corners. A good rotating arm sprinkler will save you lots of time and do a better job than you will by hand.</p>
            
            <h4>Small Tools</h4>
            <p>Make a dibble from an old tool handle and use it to make holes for transplants. You will need a small trowel. A sharp knife serves many needs.</p>
            
            <h4>Dusters, Sprayers</h4>
            <p>You will need these before the season is over to help you control insects and plant diseases.</p>

          <header>These Vegetables are Easiest to Grow (Table)</header>
          <article>
            <p>If given the proper care, the right soil and climate conditions, almost any vegetable you mention can be raised successfully. Great strides have been made in the last ten years by seed growers in developing straings of vegetables that can withstand the attacks of certain diseases and even hold their own against some insects.</p>
            <p>Generally speaking, the annual vegetables (those that must be planted each year) are easier to grow and require less attention than the perennials, such as asparagus, rhubarb and strawberries. But even with the annuals it is well for the beginner to leave out of his plans certain vegetables that are subject to persisten insects or diseases or which require a lot of attention. These include watermelons, cauliflower, cantaloupes, celery and cucumbers. Avoid growing these until you have gone through two or three seasons of gardening.</p>
            <p>Another good point to remember in selecting your variety, is that such vegetables as parnsips, cabbage, okra and onions from seeds take a long time to mature, during all of which time they must have your attention.</p>
            <p>Don't hesistate to try out some of the newer or more uncommon vegetable such as Chinese cabbage, Celtuce or the yellow tomatoes. They require no more skill to raise than peas, beans or corn. Try them! They will add interest to your garden.</p>

          <!--Insert image here from page10 -->
            <h4>Planting and Succession Crops</h4>
            <p>Plan 1 and the Alternate Plan 1 show gardens which should be started as early in the spring as possible. Then follow through with "succession crops" (examples may be found on pages 13 and 15). You will be surprised and delightfully amazed at the large quantity of crisp, flavor full vegetables that will reward your efforts.</p>
            <p>As explained on pages 4 and 24 you should plan to grow "succession crops". Plan on paper exactly which vegetables you and your family like, study the facts about them on Pages 26 and 27, note the ones to plant early and late and check with the suggestions of replacement crops given with Plans 2 and 3. Then your Victory Garden will produce double the vegetables - and you'll have fun all summer.</p>
            <p>These two plans, 10 x 15 and 15 x 25 can be adapted for any small-sized space that measure about 150 to 400 square feet. Do no heitate to change the selection of items to suit your own individual tastes. THe vegetables covered in this plan are comparatively simple to grow. It is assumed, of course, that you will do a good job of soil preparation and cultivation are your crops start to grow.</p>

            <p>This is a much larger garden than it looks on paper! Measure the space off outside and see how really big it is. Do not plan this size if you are a "weekend" gardener and must do all the work by yourself. It will take the spare time of two people. For convenience in planting, the garden has been divided into two sections. Most of the late maturing crops are in the second section.</p>

          <header>Start a Compost Heap</header>
          <article>
            <p>There's a gold mine for your Victory Garden in a compost heap. As it is made up of most of the things you rake up and throw out, it means but little more in work. It makes as fine a humus for your soil as money can buy and yet it costs very little.</p>
            
            <p>Compost is made up of grass cuttings, fallen leaves, flower clippings and other vegetable matter collected from your garden and lawn. You may add potato peelings, bean and pea pods, carrot tops and other clean garbage from the kitchen.</p>
            
            <p>Select an inconspicuous spot in your yard for your compost heap, because, to be frank, it is not very attractice. For a start turn over about six square feet of soil or make a shallow hole (six inches deep will do) of the same size. Then week to week, as you collect clean vegetation throw it all together in a pile. After the pile is about a food high, add a light layer of top soil to hasten decomposition. Continue with new layers of clipping, grass and soil. Never add diseased vegetation to the heap as it may spread disease. Burn that sort of thing.</p>
            <p>Keep the top of the compost heap concave so that rain water, instead of spilling off the top, will soak through and help the mixture to decay more rapidly. If the summer should be dry, soak the heap whenever you water the garden with the hose.
            </p>
            <p>An occasional sprinkling of fertilizer will enrich the compost and speed its decay. Most compost heaps will not have a strong odor, but if yours does, a sprinkling of ordinary lime will clear it up. The addition of acid phosphate once in a while will kill any flies or other insects that may use it as a breeding place.</p>
            
            <p>Once every six weeks take your spading fork and turn the compost completely over so that the outside parts are placed in the center. This will hasten decay and make for a more even mixture.</p>
            
            <p>The heap should stand over winter before ou attempt to use it as you would use other types of humus. Spread it two or three inches thick over your garden before you turn the ground over. If you want to be especially careful in using it, spread it in the bottom of the trenches formed as you are digging the soil. The consisten use of humus will make your ground very productive.</p>

          <header>You Should Have a Coldframe</header>
          <article>
            <p>When the inexperienced gardener hears the word "Coldframe" he thinks that only an expert could build one or know how to use it. The facts are that school-boy could build a satisfactory Coldframe from a packing case cut in half.</p>
            <p>The main purpose of a Coldframe is to give your plants a head start. You will be able to plant your seeds a month before you could out in the open garden. When the proper planting time comes you have strong seedling plants ready for transplanting, thus gaining 4 to 5 weeks on the regular garden season.</p>
            <h4>Construction</h4>
            <p>A Coldframe is really a shallow box with a top cover of glass and no bottom. One three by five is a good size, but if you have an old window sash to use for a cover, build your frame to fit it. In all cases the back of the frame should be five or six inches higher than the front so that the rain will run off. The front of the frame should be ten or twlve inches high. The back should be fifteen to eighteen inches in height. Use good solid lumber, one or two inches thick, and cover with a moisture-proof paint. It is apt to rot if you don't.</p>
            <h4>Soil</h4>
            <p>The frame should be set over soil that has been specially prepared. Dig down about six inches where the frame is going to be set. Refill the hole with a loose mixture of garden soil and humus, leaf mold, peat moss or well-decayed compost. Press slightly and level off. ANother soil mixture that may be used is equal parts of sand and peat moss.</p>
            <h4>Location</h4>
            <p>Place the frame in a protected place, next to a garage, fence or house. The spot should have good drainage. Face the front of the frame South.</p>
            <h4>Planting</h4>
            <p>Sow the seeds directly in the Coldframe in rows about two inches apart. During favorable weather raise the glass top an inch or two. When the day is very mild raise the top all the way. If the weather turns cold, close the top and cover with some heavy material such as burlap or an old quilt.</p>
            <p>After planting, water lightly so that the soil in the frame will not get too dry. If allowed to dry out, the seeds will not germinate. Watch it carefully. There are three dangers- leaving the sash off on cold frosty nights or days, elaving the sash on, on nice sunny days when ventilation is necessary, and forgetting to water.</p>
            <p>Your tender young plants will be ready for transplanting when they are two or three inches high or when they have put out their second set of leaves. Do not disturb the roots any more than you have to.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Preparation_of_the_soil">
          <header>Preparation of the Soil</header>
          <article>
            <p>The importance of good soil preparation cannot be overemphasized because this is where your gardening job starts. Unless you are willing to do a good job here, you might as well give up. The difference between a good crop or a poor crop lies in soil prepartion. Remember that no vegetable can give you more than it finds in the soil, for the simple reason that everything it gives you comes from the soil. The answer to this is proper soil preparation.</p>
            <h4>DIG! DIG! DIG!</h4>
            <p>Vegetables, yes, even down to their roots, ahve to breathe air. That's why the soil must be loosened and broken up to the full depth of your garden spade. Get at this digging just as soon as the ground thaws, the earlier the better. However, one warning, don't start to dig until the earth falls apart when you squeeze a handful. If it is too moist it will not break up properly.</p>
            <h1>Two Methods to Choose From</h1>
            <p>First there is single digging, which to be frank, is as far as most gardeners ever get, and which in most cases is sufficient. You push your spading fork or spade down straight into the ground, not an angle, using the firm soil at the back of your tool as a pry. Don't sheat! Push the spade in as far as you can go!</p>
            <h4>Dig in Compost or Fertilizer</h4>
            <p>If you have any compost or other humus or fertilizer, such as horse or cow manure, this is the time to make use of it. Spread it evenly over the ground or place it in the trench that you open up with your spade or fork. Make sure you cover it completely so that it will be down at the level where the roots get their food.</p>
            <h4>Double Digging for Poor Soils</h4>
            <p>The next method is known as double digging. They call it "double" because you go two spadesful deep. If you have a good layer of top soil it is not necessary. Do this only when your top soil is thin or the sub-soil is so hard you have to chip it out a little at a time. With this method you should throw the top layer off to one side, the second layer off to the other side. Then you throw the top soil back in the trench first, with the second layer in on top. The top layer, which is the pooere soil, may now be improved with humus, manure or fertilizer.</p>
            <p>Whichever method you use, don't dig more than a strip four or five feet wide at one time. As you throw the dirt down, hit it with the fork, breaking up the lumps into small pieces. Do this as you go along, and don't let your digging get too far ahead of your raking. Level off the dug over ground with a good iron rake, using the back as well as the teeth to smooth out all depressions.</p>
            <h4>Use Plow if Possible</h4>
            <p>We know that most poeple with small gardens do not have a plow or tractor at their displosal. Here's a tip. If five or six other people in the neighborhood are going to have Victory Gardens, see if you can't get together an hire a farmer or contractor come in and plow up all of your gardens on the same day. It will probably cost you only $2 each and will save the hardest work gerdening requires.</p>
            <p>The next operation is to dig a trench about a foot or less in depth and as wide, carry or wheel this soil to the other end of the garden as shown in figure 1. This soil will be used to fill in the void remaining after you have completed your digging.</p>
            <p>Figure 2 illustrates the method of turning over the soil as you dig and fill each trench. The old gardener recommends that you push the spading fork straight down into the soil to its full length and then turn over each spadeful so as to work in the manure or other organic matter. Break up the lumps as they appear and throw out any large stones, roots or other undesirable matter. Do not dig too deep nor turn up the subsoil.</p>
            <p>Work up the soil as you dig and smooth it as much as possible to make raking easy. The main purpose is to level off and pulverize the top three or four inches to make a good bed for your seeds and plants. Victory Garden Fertilizer, at the rate of 3 to 4 pounds for each 100 square feet of garden area should be spread over and raked well into the soil after the digging and leveling operation has been accomplished. Digging is back-breaking, but it is grand exercise. Wait until the garden soil is dry enough before you start to dig. Soil which sticks in a ball when it is pressed in the hand is too wet to be worked - wait until it crumbles under pressure.</p>
            <!--insert image from page 19 -->
            <h4>Types of Soil</h4>
            <p>Clay - A clay soil is stiff and heavy; it warms up slowly in the spring and cannot be dug as early as a light sandy soil. However, it is a fine soil once it is improved. It retains plant foods and moisture very well. You can make it an excellent growing soil by adding sand, sifted coal or wood ashes, commercial humus or your own compost. Do this when you turn the soil over, mixing it thoroughly. Apply a light top dressing of lime about ten days after the digging is done, and cultivate it into the surface (Do not use lime at the same time you apply manure or a fertilizer) This type of soil is better if turned over in the fall (but not raked level) so that it is in a rough state during the winter. It will then break up into loose particles much more easily in the spring.</p>
            <p>Sandy - A sandy soil that has been improved properly, makes a fine bed for most vegetables. It does not retain moisture and nourishment until this has been done. If your soil is sandy, plant a cover crop such as buckwheat, rye or oats in the fall. Then in the spring turn the cover crop under. You will also have to add considerable quantities of humus, peat moss or your own compost. You will find that it will improve greatly each season with these treatments.</p>
            <h4>Use of Fertilizers</h4>
            <p>Fertilizers have two purposes - first, to improve the soil; second, to hasten growth. Your first use of a fertilizer will serve both purposes if you apply it when you first turn the soil over, or better still, about a week before planting, work it well into the upper part of the soil.</p>
            <p>Nitrogen, potash and phosphorus are the essential elements that are lacking in sufficient quantities in most garden soils. They should be replaced with a good commercial fertilizer. One that is especially good to use at a the beginning of the season is a commercial mixture. This year, because of war conditions, the standard formula for chemical fertilizers, will consist of three units of nitrogen, eight units of phosphorous and seven units of potash. This will be known as "Victory Fertilizer", and will be sold in lots ranging from 5 pounds to 100 pounds. Use about 5 pounds of this to 200 square feet; however be guided by your dealer in your choice of fertilizer, and follow directions given with your purchase.</p>
            <p>Cow manure and horse manure are both good for general use if you can obtain them. Other good fertilizers are bone meal, cottonseed, soubean meal and tankage. These release their elements much more slowly than commercial fertilizers and therefore will not be of much use in forcing quick growth.</p>
            <h4>Use of Lime</h4>
            <p>Do not use lime unless you know that it is needed. You can find out if your soil needs it very easily. Ask your druggist for a piece of Litmus paper. Dig up some soil and place it around the paper. If the paper turns dark red, you do not need lime. If the paper turns a bright red, lime should be used because the soil is sour. Use a finely powedered hydrated lime, and spread it sparingly over the surface of your garden, cultivating it into the top few inches of soil.</p>

          <header>Sow Your Seeds with Care</header>
          <article>
            <h4>Selection of Seed</h4>
            <p>You will miss a lot of preliminary fun if you do not send away for a few seed catalogs. They will, of course, be a guide in helping you decide which of the many different varieties you will want to grow. Don't hesitate over the relative quality of one brand over another. You will find that all packaged brands of seeds from reputable growers will be good. Total seed cost is very little, so don't buy the cheaper grades or you will be dissapointed in the results. Good seeds will give you more plants and healthier plants per ounce than cheap seeds. However, before you order any, or buy any from your local store, be sure that you know just what quantities you will need.</p>
            <h4>Good Sowing Pays Dividends</h4>
            <p>A great deal of the joy you will have from working in your garden later on, as well as the amount of food you will eventually raise, depends to a great extent upon the way you plant your seed. The first consideration is to be sure that you do not plant any seeds ahead of their scheduled planting time. </p>
            <p>After you have properly prepared and leveled off your soil, you are ready to start sowing. Get a good, strong cord, as long as your longest row in the garden, with a one-foot stake tied at each end. Use this cord, pulled taut, as a guide in laying out rows that are straight as arrows.</p>
            <p>Now study the directions for planting the seeds you are going to put in the first row...and FOLLOW THEM FAITHFULLY! If the directions say plant the seeds one inch deep make your furrow one inch deep make your furrow one inch deep. If the grower says plant the seeds two inches apart do as he recommends.</p>
            <p>The larger seeds, such as Peas and BEans, can be placed in the furrow one at a time. If the seeds are very fine, cut a small piece off the corner of the packet and tap the seeds out gently, a few at a time.</p>
            <p>To make shallow furrows use a small stick of the handle of your how or rake. For deeper furrows use the corner of your hoe.</p>
            
            <h4>Keep Distance Between Rows</h4>
            <p>It does not pay to place the rows closer together than the instructions recommend, although many gardeners do this in order to crowd more vegetables into a limited space. When rows are too close together it is impossible to cultivate them properly after the plants have grown. Under such circumstances it is possible for a row of larger plants to completely cover a neighboring row of smaller plants, either killing or preventing the latter from maturing.</p>
            <h4>Fill in and Tamp</h4>
            <p>After your seed is in, take up the guide cord and fill in the furrow to a point slightly above the level of the surrounding ground. Next, with your hoe tamp the earth down gently but firmly. Remember that too much pressure at this time is worse than none at all. Keep careless feet from trampling upon your hidden seeds by pacing a spare stake at both ends of the row.</p>
            <h4>FOLLOW PLANTING INSTRUCTIONS - IT PAYS!</h4>

          <header>Cultivation Encourages Growth</header>
          <article>
            <h4>Reasons Why</h4>
            <p>The main purpose of this favorite garden excercise, is to make it easier for the plants to get their food, moisture and air out of the soil. The second purpose is to protect them from their most relentless enemy, the weeds. A weekly scratching of the top surgace of the soil (that's all cultivation really is) keeps the ground from caking and baking. THe loose soil that results from it acts as an insulation blanket that helps to keep the sun from stealing the moisture out of the ground.</p>
            <h4>Weeds are Robbers</h4>
            <p>Weeds are the worst robbers that ever entered a garden. THey steal the things your crops must have- moisture and food! If allowed to grow too tall before they are pulled or cut down they also steal the plants' life-giving sunshine.</p>
            <h4>Use Good Tools</h4>
            <p>The cultivator that saves the most labor is the prong type. With it you use a pulling, scratching motion that will not tire you as fast as the chopping motion necessary with a garden hoe. THe prong type is handier in getting close to the plants without damanging them as is apt to happen with a hoe. You will, however, find the hoe better for chopping down the weeds if you allow them to get too tall. For large gardens you will want a wheeled cultivator such as used on small farms.</p>
            <h4>Cultivate Lightly</h4>
            <p>It is not necessary or desirable to dig your cultivating tools into the ground more than about an inch. If you go deeper you are apt to damange the plants' roots and do more harm than good. Even with light cultivation don't get too near the plant roots use your hands to pull out weeds that are near plants.</p>
            <h4>Use Mulch Between Rows</h4>
            <p>A simple but effective way to keep weeds down and reduce the area you have to cultivate, is to spread a thin layer of grass clippings or straw between the rows.</p>
            <p>A final tip- cultivate as often as you can soon after rainstorms. The earth is softer and requires less work to loosen up. Weeds pull out much easier after a rain.</p>
            <h4>Your Crops Need Water</h4>
            <p>If you are lucky enough to get a good rain once a week you will not have to use the hose. If you are not there is nothing to do but haul out the hose and give everything a good soak. Never give your garden a light soaking as that has a tendency to attract the roots to the surface where they will be damaged during the next dry spell. Use a rorating arm sprinkler to save time and do a better job.</p>

          <header>Succession of Crops Very Profitable</header>
          <article>
            <p>You can increase the returns from your Victory Garden by 50% if you carefully plan on paper, just what crops you will plant to replace those that re harvested first. This is called succession of crops. It not only makes your garden space do double duty if it is small, but it will also enable you to have a consisten supply of the same vegetables for your table during the summer and early fall.</p>
            <p>For example, make successive plantings every two weeks of lettuce, peas, beans, spinach, carrots, beets and corn until several crops are coming in. In this way you will get at least two or three crops to keep you well supplied.</p>
            <p>You can get the same results by planting at the same time, vegetables that mature at different times, but it is more difficult to control the variety with this method.</p>
            <p>The earlier you get your garden started (not before the ground is workable, of course) the more crops you will be able to raise in succession. This is the main reason so many gardeners make plantings in a Coldframe before the outdoor planting season starts. The use anc construction of a Coldframe is outlined on page 17</p>
            <p>The Victory gardener, especially the one with a small family and a small plot, should bear in mind that it is better to plant a small amount every two or three weeks, than it is to plant a big quantity all at once, because he will not be able to use all of the resulting crops while they are young and tender.</p>
            <h4>Remember When First Frosts are Due</h4>
            <p>In planning successive crops you should check on the time the first autumn frosts are due in your locality. For instance, if a frost usually comes around October 15th, then you should make your last sowing about 1st of August for such crops as dwarf beans, beets, Swiss chard, carrots, endive and lettuce. Since they take a shorter period to mature, radishes and spinach could still be sown as late as September 1st. These dates will serve you as a guide. Adjust your plantings accordingly if the first severe frost come earlier or later.</p>
            <p>Don't be content with one crop. Before you actually start work outdoors, get pencil, paper, and charts and schedule the dates of plantings so that you will be assured of a constant supply all summer of a good variety of tender vegetables.</p>

          <header>Use of Supports for Tomatoes, Peas and Beans</header>
          <article>
            <p>Peas, Pole Beans, Tomatoes and other heavey or tall growing plants such as Egg PLants, need good strong supports to grow properly. THese supports should be set in the ground while the plants are quite young. If you wait until they really need the suppots, you will harm the roots of the plants when you put them in.</p>
            <p>The supports should be strong enough to bear the weight of the ripened vegetables. Even if the supports themselves are strong, they may be pulled over if you do not place them deep enough in the ground</p>
            <p>Good, strong supports, placed securely in the ground will keep your rows clear for cultivation and the vegetables off the ground where they may rot before they ripen. Sunshine will also reach all parts of the plants and thus hasten ripening.</p>

            <!--1st row, 3 columns -->
            <h4>Two Types For Tomatoes</h4>
            <h4>Single Pole</h4>
            <p>Should be 3 or 4 ft. above ground and 1 ft. in the ground. Poles should be at least 1 in. thick. Place in ground close to plant when young. Tie plant to pole as it grows. This type commonly used.</p>
            <h4>Tri-pod Type</h4>
            <p>Use three 4 ft. poles tied together at top. Place top over center of individual plants and tieup branches as they grow or place the tri-pod in the center of three plants and tie a plant to each pole as it grows. Push tri-pod poles few inches into ground</p>
            <!-- 2nd row, 3 columns -->
            <h4>Brushwood Stakes for Peas</h4>
            <p>Use good, bushy pieces of shrubs or breanches. Push 8 inches in ground with 3 or 4 ft. above ground. Leave brances on brush. Peas will climb up of own accord, although you may have to start them doing so at first.</p>
            <h4>Strong Poles for Pole Beans and Pole Lima Beans</h4>
            <p>Use poles 7 or 8 ft. tall, 2 inces wide at base. Set firmly 1 or 1 1/2 ft. in ground before you plant the seeds. Leave short ends of brances on poles to help plants climb. Tie plants to pole as they start to grow.</p>

          <article>
            <p>Prompt and proper action will control your garden pests to a great extent. To this end you must view your garden with an inquisitive eye from day to day. Examine the undersides of your spinach for aphids, look for the large green tomato worm. If any of your vegetables look sick, find out why and take corrective measures at once. If you can't diagnose the case yourself, usually the other gardeners in your vicinity can help. Your County Agricultural Bureau is always ready to be of service to you.</p>
            <p>The destructive insects that invade your garden are divided into two classes. The chewing insects obtain their food by chewing the leaves, fruit, flowers and stems of the plants. THe second class, called sucking insects, live on plant juices.</p>
            <p>The first group of chewing insects are controlled by spraying or dusting the plants with stomach insecticides, such as a lead arsenate, clacium arsenate.</p>
